**PROJECT EXPERIENCES**
 PDM and OVP for US Clients 01/2023 06/2025
 1. Automated extraction of patient demographics for over 5,000 medical charts daily, boosting productivity by 400+ hours per
 month and achieving over 90% field-level accuracy.
 2. Pioneered a solution for the "Extraction of Patient Demographic Fields" from Pathological Medical charts. Achieved an over
 90% field accuracy for key entities, including Patient Name, Account Number, DOB, DOS, Gender, Provider Name, MRN, Age,
 Discharge Date, Admit Date and Location, leveraging OCR on parsed JSON data extracted from Patient PDFs.
 3. Leveraged LLM Based OpenAI's ChatGPT model to streamline and automate the extraction process. By providing tailored
 prompts and processing model responses, successfully extracted specific information from PDF-processed medical texts
 4. Monthly 400+ Hours of Productivity utilizing Generative AI Capabilities.
 Developed OCR code to automatically split PDFs containing multiple patient reports into individual reports based on predefined
 criteria.
 5. Oversaw daily production operations for over 5000 medical charts, analysing issues and resolving issues, including updating
 Care Cloud and rectifying data discrepancies.
 6. Managed Docker containers and Jenkins deployment, including pipeline script creation. Monitored system health, identified and
 resolved issues and proactively managed thread creation with a focus on Apache NiFi Server.
 Utilized OpenAI GPT-4o mini to reduce costs by approximately 30% and cut efforts and working hours by around 40%
 compared to traditional Regex methods, significantly enhancing extraction efficiency.
 Tech Stack: Python, OCR, OpenAI GPT-4, Docker, Jenkins, Apache NiFi, Care Cloud, SQL, MS Excel.
